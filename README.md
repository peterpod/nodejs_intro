nodejs_intro
============
This is an introductory repo for some basic nodejs and javascript scripts.

The repo includes a redefined cat and ls command that takes in a variable number of arguments.

HelloworldServer is also an example of nodeJs code where you can run a simple web server. 
The page displays any basic html page but I chose a static index.hmtl content page for the barebones example.

---------------
Improved Server
---------------
This code features an improve webserver that can process dynamic requests such as form actions.
The code within this directory provides an example of a class method(Car.js) that returns 
to the server simple JSON using the form which acts as a class constructor. The server
can then process this response and display it back to the user.

The HTML page uses the ajax $.getJSON() function to access this class data.
