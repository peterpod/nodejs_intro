This is an introductory repo for some basic nodejs 
and javascript scripts.

The repo includes a redefined cat and ls 
command that takes in a variable number of arguments.

HelloworldServer is also an example of nodeJs code where you 
can run a simple web server. The page displays any basic
html page but I chose a static index.hmtl content page for 
the barebones example.
